# Rocket-Trajectory-3DoF
3 Degree of Freedom solver to predict trajectory of sounding rockets 


This script utilised the standard atmospheric mdoelling equations and ordinary differential equations to plot the trajectory of rocket. 

This code utilises some aspects written by my colleauge Reza Aliakbri (reza.aliakbri@rmit.edu.au)
